# WebGL

This repo is all about the intro to WebGL and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language).

WebGL is a collective of API that enbles you to get access to OpenGL with JavaScript.

General steps for you to declare 'Hello World' is...
1. create an HTML canvas, and get the webGL context.
2. reset the webGL settings such as color, depth, and canvas itsef.
3. create vertex and fragment shader in GLSL.
4. also create shader, program, and others in your JS script.
5. declare functions that create v/f shader, program, vbo, etc.



 Declare an HTML canvas element in HTML, or createElement('canavs'), store it in a variable called canvas, and append it in body in script.js.
